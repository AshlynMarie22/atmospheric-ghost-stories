## Title

Cryptic Encounters

## Description

This project is a walk-through of a haunted house in which the user can interact with the spirits inside in different ways to get different dialogue responses and therefore, a different version of the spirits' stories. The user finds themselves trapped in a haunted house, and is instructed by a greeter ghost to speak with each of the ghosts in the house and free them from the home before being allowed to leave. Each spirit has a story, and you have to help them tell their story and escape, or you'll become trapped too!
