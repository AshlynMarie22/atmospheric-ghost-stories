                    I was born in ST. LOUIS but I spent most of my life in this house. My husband, CHARLIE, and
                    I
                    loved this home. We raised our family here. My children took their first steps right over there by
                    the
                    fireplace. I somehow got stuck here forever. You will probably meet other spirits around here
                    somewhere, so
                    make
                    sure to stay on their good side, or you won’t get the key so you can leave. Can you help?

                    They are other spirits like myself, who were trapped here throughout time, but we want to
                    leave
                    now. When I died in a BMX accident, I just couldn’t let myself leave here. And now I’m stuck. Just
                    give
                    the
                    others one of these keys and get on their good side to convince them to leave the house for good. If
                    you
                    help
                    me, I can leave.`
