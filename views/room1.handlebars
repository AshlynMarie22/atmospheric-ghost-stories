            I
            just wanted to
            make
            sure you were alright. You seem...distracted. You just walked in here with a dazed look. Do you need
            anything?
            What's your name?`

            so
            much I can do around here these days. It’s been so long since I’ve had new company.`

            I
            loved this home. We raised our family here. My children took their first steps right over there by the
            fireplace. I somehow got stuck here forever. You will probably meet other spirits around here somewhere, so
            make
            sure to stay on their good side, or you won’t get the key so you can leave. Can you help?`

            leave
            now. When I died in a BMX accident, I just couldn’t let myself leave here. And now I’m stuck. Just give
            the
            others one of these keys and get on their good side to convince them to leave the house for good. If you
