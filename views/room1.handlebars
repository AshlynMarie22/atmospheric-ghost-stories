            I
            just wanted to
            make
            sure you were alright. You seem...distracted. You just walked in here with a dazed look. Do you need
            anything?
            What's your name?`

            {{#if positive}}`My name is GERTRUDE, and this is my home. Welcome. I’m sorry for the mess, there’s only
            so
            much I can do around here these days. It’s been so long since I’ve had new company.`
            {{else}}`Oh, calm down. My name is GERTRUDE and this is my home. Normally I would welcome visitors, please
            be kind and don’t make me change my mind.`

            {{#if positive}}`I was born in ATLANTA but I spent most of my life in this house. My husband, CHARLIE, and I
            loved this home. We raised our family here. My children took their first steps right over there by the
            fireplace. I somehow got stuck here forever. You will probably meet other spirits around here somewhere, so
            make
            sure to stay on their good side, or you won’t get the key so you can leave. Can you help?`
            {{else}}`This is my home. Do not speak of it like that. I worked my whole life for this house. Are you going
            to
            help us or not?`

        <p>
            {{#if positive}}`They are other spirits like myself, who were trapped here throughout time, but we want to
            leave
            now. When I died in a BMX accident, I just couldn’t let myself leave here. And now I’m stuck. Just give
            the
            others one of these keys and get on their good side to convince them to leave the house for good. If you
            help
            me, I can leave.`
