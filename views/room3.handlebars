    {{#if positive}} `I was one of the first people to build permanently on this patch of land. Greetings, my name is
    BARNABY JENKINS. Welcome to my land. I was here when we were still a loyal colony. I came from LIVERPOOL to provide
    my pious services to this wild place.`
    {{else}}`I am not a demon, you fool. I'm a simple, god-fearing preacher who who travelled from across the ocean to
    settle this vast land with my family and provide ministry for others like us.`

    {{!-- user: pos: "Oh wow, so you've been in the house the longest?", neg. "Okay, well demons are mean, so..." --}}

    {{#if positive}} `Not exactly. For a long time my wife, BARBARA, and I wandered in the overgrown potato fields
    outside after our cabin finally collapsed from old age. When GERTRUDE built her house on the same land, I got stuck
    inside her house. I don't know what happened to the rest of my family.`
    {{else}}`Do not mistake my annoyance for ill intent. I help take care of this place and I don't like visitors
    disturbing the peace. I once took care of the outside fields for a long time until this house was built and I became
    trapped inside.`

    {{!-- User: pos. "I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope they're okay.", neg. "Well, you can't stop me." --}}

    {{#if positive}}`Thank you. I believe they have been set free somehow. I don't know why I'm still here, but it may
    have something to do with my insistence that this land is mine and only mine. In my younger days on the homestead,
    we had to fight each other for resources, and maybe I wasn't so kind to my neighbors. Perhaps that's why I'm stuck.`
    {{else}}`Do not test me child. I will chase you away like I chased the others away.`
    {{/if}}

    {{!-- User: pos. "It must have been a difficult life. Can I help you?", neg. "Well, you can't really stop me." --}}

    {{#if positive}} `I would appreciate any help. I just want to leave this house.`
    {{else}}`OH REALLY?`
